1 -> A
2 -> B
3 -> C
...
26 -> Z
27 -> AA
28 -> AB 
Convert integer to string .

No. is =>   (26^a)a1 + (26^a-1)an ..... an.
Access last digit by modulo with 26 and move to left by dividing with 26.


A = (A - 1)/26 is important because for case. 
A = 52 so answer is AZ so we can't blindly divide put -1 also.
string ans = "";
while(A){
    ans = (char)((A-1)%26 + 'A') + ans;
    A = (A-1)/26;
}
return ans;
